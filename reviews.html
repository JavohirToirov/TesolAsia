                            the basics and become more particular and careful with my grammar. It also helped me use
                            other approaches on how to become more effective and efficient as an educator. Ultimately,
                            it gave me more confidence and drive to teach my students whilst maintaining the fun. My
                            tutor was a gem. She was very responsive and inspiring. I would definitely recommend the
                            INTESOL program to my colleagues and English teacher friends because it is very helpful.</p>

                            create an environment for growth and learning. Generously shared knowledge and skills.
                            Offered support, time, respected individual styles. Always there, always present, always
                            herself. There is nothing I read before coming on the course that prepared me for the

                            needed to pick up the phone and ask for advice, one of the team at INTESOL would always call

                            doing the course because I was able to review the basic principles in English grammar as
                            well as the strategies in TEFL. In addition, INTESOL was very helpful in my part since I am
                            teaching English in an Online Company which is based in China. It helped me improved my
                            teaching competence and strategies. Hence, I would definitely recommend taking INTESOL to

                            that the remote learning course offered me. It was everything that I hoped it would be,
                            thorough, detailed and challenging, and it is set up in such a way that help is always at
                            hand if you need it. My tutor, was a star and was always on the end of an email for advice
                            or guidance. Finally, INTESOL even helped me to find a teaching placement near to where I
                            live and set everything up for me, so all I had to do was go and teach!</p>

                            Turkey and it’s fantastic. I am being treated very well and I’m overwhelmed by the
                            treatment, in fact I’m being treated like a VIP wherever I go. I am happy in Turkey as I
                            enjoy history and this area is packed with historical places.
                            I am teaching at a ‘British Culture’ school and its sister organisation which is a
                            children’s school. I am very grateful for the chance and I have been asked to find some
                            teachers for summer so when this is confirmed I will ask yourself to forward some teachers
                            and their details.</p>

                            The whole course was well written, clear, interesting and well thought out. It was full of
                            useful class-based activities which I will always refer to when I start teaching. The course
                            structure and content was way better than I had imagined. I was impressed by the practical
                            methods and strategies that the student teachers are encouraged to use in an ESOL class, and
                            also the structured approach to the course was easy to follow. I learned a lot about
                            motivating students in a classroom, building their confidence, and supporting their language
                            learning process. I gained an understanding of language acquisition and how second language
                            learning differs from learning one’s native tongue.</p>

                            assignments were checked as scheduled and sometimes earlier. It was a nice gesture for me
                            because the course speeded up and I finished the course by the end of January. To be honest,
                            the course was daunting. There were times that I lost my motivation, but Mr. Semakin’s
                            feedback and praise gave me motivation and confidence. I never received bad feedback despite
                            my low performance. As an adult who knows how to control emotions and situations, I realized
                            that praises, without a doubt, have a good effect no matter your age. Those saved me. Also,
                            I was well-guided throughout the course. My mistakes were properly corrected, instructions
                            that I missed were pointed up nicely.
