                    Hazelwood has been teaching languages since 1971. Since then she has taught in England and overseas,
                    in both the public and private sectors, in primary, senior and adult education. She also has
                    experience of English for Academic Purposes and materials writing at university level. Lynda has
                    been employed by the British Council for whom she taught all levels including Cambridge exam classes

                    provided including one-to-one language tuition; adult language classes; French clubs for 5 – 11 year
                    olds; English home stays for foreign learners and weekend introductory courses in Teaching English
                    to Speakers of Other Languages. The most successful of these became the weekend introductory courses
                    in TESOL. 80% of the participants wanted to take a course, which would qualify them to teach ESOL,
                    but most could not give up four weeks of their time to study. Lynda decided to develop course
                    materials for home study which soon developed into the world renowned INTESOL Certificate in TESOL
                    by distance learning. A short time later the course achieved accreditation and is now one of the
                    most respected courses worldwide.</p>
